## Rules

Each player takes turn removing one of the community cards and placing one of the cards from their hand. You score points based on the poker hand that the community cards make. If the card you just played is only a kicker in the hand, you do not get any points.

On any turn, you can forego playing a card to peek at all your opponents' hands.

The cards stay in the community even after points are dealt, so an opponent can turn the three of a kind you just played and turn it into a four of a kind or a full house.
